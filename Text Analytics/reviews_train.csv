finally due to the help of some other consultants i completed my task again this povert waste and unsubjected fellow vijayarajan ramakrishnan chenge the output, at that time my frustation is in peaks because i developed the based on fsd only,i replied like why you want to confuse the client with critical code based on fsd this one is a simplest way like that said.6. consultants always help us and said like you have to speak .7. frankly speaking in the sense why i need to speak and convense the leads, by seeing the code itself its thier responsibelity to understand the code right, but here we need to explain and convense them(because they didnot have a any technical knowledge they just want the result they didnot consider how it came.5.in meeting these stupid lead always said like you are a technical consultant handle it anyway but actually that problem existed from its previous version onwards,if you tell this then they will realise and said that yes we canot do anything because it is existed from previous version onwards,leave the issue.7.if you are a silent means they will thought like take an advantage .",0

"One of my experience was very bad due to below reasons:
1. Required to work more than 12 hours in one of the projects.
2. Shift allowances are not good.
3. Company has reduced shift allowances remarkably, reduced cab services even for female employees, removed floor newspaper, coffee machines and many other internal service stoppage due to cost cut down policy.

7. Compensation calculation is below average. Increments are not good. for few job designations, other than basic were increased. 
8. No proper escalation matrix in some projects.

"For the Automotive domain engineering department at Noida location, following holds very true:

1. Low quality work:  Mostly Manual Test Procedure creation work in Excel which does not require any technical skills and is more on the laborious side. 
2. Lack common ethics : ex:Most of the lateral hires are told of the development work in order to lure them to join, only to realize later that there was no such work and will never be coming.
3. People normally leave within 6-9 months of joining. They had joined here expecting the  XYZ culture heard from their friends, only to later find out that this department comes under SOGETI, which is ignored and worse than even the small indian companies.
4. Third class atmosphere with managers and tech-leads looking at your computer screens from behind all the time like a bania company. You will be judged on the basis of the hours you spend at the cafeteria & computer screen and not the work quality & amount
5. Small minded managers and POLITICS : Managers give very clear priority to juniors who show sycophancy and promote this attitude among other fellow employees. Technical skills is of low value for them. After few months, you will be well trained in politics and will be confident enough to join corrupted parties like congress and BSP .
6. Average annual appraisal range - 3-5%
7. Poor transportation : need to pay 1400rs/month from your salary. Have to reach a nodal point 2-3 kms away from home everyday. 
8. Get escalated for small matters : if missed the bus twice, you will barred from using transport for that month unless u ask your manager to place a request to transportation.
9. Ailing infrastructure ( an old Patni office, which has been re-branded as XYZ but could gain the parent's work culture). People still work on desktop for automotive software development.
10. No onsites ( But fake promises to file an H1B next year will always be there)

Nowadays it feels like I'm going to school again not the office. If you don't follow the dress code they will take your details at entrance and then you need to deal  with HR.

"I want to share my experience with XYZ with you all, The reason this is so long is because i don't this to happen with any one else, my cons review might be Lengthy .but, it's true to its core as I had personally gone through all of that :-
  
            It all started when my One on one meeting for appraiser cycle did't happened. I remember exactly that there were few of the team members who were close to manager, there rating was disclosed to them and the were getting double promotion. like many other employee i asked for the 1 on 1 till last day of rating cycle, but i was shut saying ""tomorrow we will take"".
            After rating came i told this to my senior manager and the HR about this but no response.Hr told just ask then regularly regarding this i can't do anything!!

             Later after lots of requests my meeting took place, In that meeting the manager was very aggressive and rude while talking,  like i was a criminal. Even after delivering all the projects on time and getting appreciation by the client themselves. 
    His one sentence that i still remember is ""I don't want to here your grand father story""
which he shouted loudly in a very rude manner.Who talks to there employee like this??
              Ever since then i was the target of them, They tried each and everything they could to make me quite.
 I want to share few of the incidents that took after that day:-
1)I had applied the leaves earlier and it got approved. when i came back i saw many mails stating that ,i took leaves  without permission and the project is in bad shape and its totally my fault!! In mail CC all the higher managers were there.

2)I showed them the mails that here the proof of my leaves approved by my supervisor, bt again i was shut in a rude manner.Againg i went to HR and asked for help but she did nothing.

3)Later when i was sick the manager fill my timesheets and marked all week absent even i had worked on that day!! Seriously who does that.??

4)I was put in 3 projects at the same time one morning shift, one normal shift and night shift, When i told my manager i can work 24 hrs he again shouted, I told HR again no help.

5)Then one day the biggest incident happens, I was sick and could't attend to office.
 MY MANAGER SEND EMPLOYEES TO MY ROOM TO CHECK IF I AM THERE OR NOT!!
      You may thing that's funny but believe me it was not, I was having worst experience of my life, I was in continuous mental pressure,I even asked for release from that project, i asked for transfer but no help,I asked for help to hr i discussed everything to them i was continuously ignored. 
    The incident does't stop there, even all my friends knew what was happening with me,Few of them advise to keep each and everything in mails and that i did.
later when these things keep on happening i decided to left the job and believe me it was not over yet. 
   when you leave company theirs a column of ""REASON"" of leaving, I did't wanted this to happen with anyone else so i mentioned the actual reason. That was the day when things get worst the managers were so aggressive to take revenge that they were blaming me for everything.
         Now the day come when HR called for meeting, She told me that only you me and your manager will be there and we will discuss your concerns. I agreed for the meeting.
         The meeting started at 3 pm and guess what there were 6 MEMBERS AND I WAS ALONE. They were firing there false allegations on me and the HR was just one of them, I explained each and every thing to them but still no one believed. when i told i have proof of everything that i am saying then they all started shouting so that i will stop speaking.Few of then created stories of there own!!
        I told several time to the that i am not comfortable with so many people ,If you want to talk just tak one after another,But again i was shut!!I was already in the worst mental state and the did't care. 
        The meeting took place for 7 Hours!! without any break...I was numb and exhausted. 
       I did't knew what to do i want to leave this company asap coz it was killing me,It was worst phase of my life.I even thought of leaving without serving notice period but could do that coz experience letter.
       I went to XYZ HR India head, they removed me from that project while i was serving notice period.But no help in what happened with me.
       last day i send a mail to all the seniors management describing each and ever thing that happened with me so that no one else had to go through that again. 
      i attached all the proofs that i had in a mail and send to them,  when i left the job after 1 month i got a mail from HR head that i did't provide any proofs!!
As a reply i send them 7 HOUR OF AUDIO RECORDING OF THE MEETING CONDUCTED!! and asked never to contact me again.
  
  Guys i just want you all now to suffer what i had gone through.

 This company has worst managers that you can ever imagine
